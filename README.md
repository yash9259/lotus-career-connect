## Candidate Auth: Phase-Wise Backend Plan

This project now includes a Phase-1 candidate auth backend simulation in the frontend (localStorage + route guards) so you can test login/register immediately.

### Phase 1 (Implemented now): Local backend simulation

- Candidate register saves user data in `localStorage`.
- Candidate login checks saved credentials and creates a session token.
- Admin login is supported with:
	- Email: `admin@hkjobs.com`
	- Password: `admin123`
- Protected routes:
	- Candidate routes: `/dashboard/*`
	- Admin route: `/admin`

### Phase 2: Real Auth API (Node/Express + PostgreSQL)

- Create APIs:
	- `POST /api/auth/register-candidate`
	- `POST /api/auth/login`
	- `POST /api/auth/logout`
	- `GET /api/auth/me`
- Replace localStorage user store with DB tables:
	- `users`
	- `candidate_profiles`
	- `sessions` (optional when using refresh tokens)
- Use password hashing (`bcrypt`) and JWT access/refresh tokens.

### Phase 3: Candidate Profile Domain APIs

- Create candidate CRUD APIs:
	- `GET /api/candidate/profile`
	- `PUT /api/candidate/profile`
	- `POST /api/candidate/resume`
	- `PUT /api/candidate/education`
	- `PUT /api/candidate/experience`
	- `PUT /api/candidate/references`
- Move registration flow fields into normalized profile tables.

### Phase 4: Security + Verification

- Add email verification OTP.
- Add password reset flow.
- Add login throttling and account lock policy.
- Add audit logs for auth and profile updates.

### Phase 5: Production Hardening

- Add API validation (Zod/class-validator) and centralized error handling.
- Add observability (request logs + metrics).
- Add integration tests for auth and profile routes.
- Add CI checks for lint, tests, and migrations.
